# Apache Hamilton Language Server (`hamilton_lsp`)

This is an implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to provide a rich IDE experience when creating Apache Hamilton dataflows.

It currently powers the Apache Hamilton VSCode extension and could be integrated into other IDEs.
