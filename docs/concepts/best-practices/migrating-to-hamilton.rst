Migrating to Apache Hamilton
=====================

Here are two suggestions for helping you migrate to Apache Hamilton

Continuous Integration for Comparisons
--------------------------------------

Create a way to easily & frequently compare results.

#. Integrate with continuous integration (CI) system if you can.
#. üîéüêõ  Having a means that tests code early & often will helps diagnose bugs in your old code (most likely) or your new implementation (less likely).
#. Specifically, have a system to compare the output of your Apache Hamilton code, to compare to the output of your existing system.

Integrate into your code base via a `"custom wrapper object"`
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you have existing systems that you want to integrate Apache Hamilton into, it might require non-trivial effort for you to
change those systems to be able to use Apache Hamilton. If that's the case, then we suggest creating a "custom object" to
"wrap" Apache Hamilton, so that it's easier to migrate to it.

Specifically, this custom wrapper object class's purpose is to match your existing API expectations. It will act as the
translation layer from your existing API expectations, to what running Apache Hamilton requires, and back. In Apache Hamilton
terminology, this is a `Custom Driver Wrapper`, since it wraps around the Apache Hamilton Driver class.

This is a best practice because:

#. When migrating, it's best to avoid making too many changes. So don't change your API expectations if you can.
#. It allows you to easily insert Apache Hamilton into any context. Thereby minimizing potential migration problems.
